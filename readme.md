# AI Research & Content Generator

## What This Does

This project is an AI-powered tool that takes any topic, researches extensively across multiple sources and automatically creates:

- **Detailed research reports** with trend analysis
- **Social media posts** for LinkedIn, Twitter, and blog content
- **Visual content** using AI image generation

Built for the **Google ADK Hackathon 2025**, it uses Google's Agent Development Kit to coordinate multiple AI agents working together.

## How It Works

### üîç Step 1: Information Gathering

The system searches multiple sources in parallel:

- **Reddit** - Community discussions and opinions
- **News APIs** - Latest articles and headlines
- **Exa AI** - Web content, tweets, and LinkedIn posts

### üìä Step 2: Smart Analysis

AI agents analyze the collected data to find:

- **Key trends** and patterns
- **Important relationships** between topics
- **Sentiment** and public opinion
- **Emerging themes** and insights

### üìù Step 3: Content Creation

Generates multiple content formats:

- **Professional reports** with Key facts and points highlighted
- **Blog** with AI-generated images
- **LinkedIn posts** for business networking
- **Twitter threads** for viral engagement
-

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent System** - Different AI agents handle specific tasks
- **Parallel Processing** - Faster results by running multiple searches at once
- **Visual Content** - Auto-generates relevant images using Gemini AI
- **Web Interface** - Easy-to-use Streamlit dashboard
- **Real-time Updates** - See progress as agents work

## Quick Start

1. **Install Requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Up API Keys** (create `.env` file)

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   EXA_API_KEY=your_key_here
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_here
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id_here
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret_here
   ```

3. **Run the App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run workflow/workflow.py
   ```

4. **Enter Any Topic** and watch the AI create comprehensive content!

## Example Topics

- **Tech Events**: "Google I/O 2025", "Apple WWDC 2025"
- **Industry Trends**: "AI Agent Development", "Future of VR"
- **Current Events**: Any trending topic you want to analyze
