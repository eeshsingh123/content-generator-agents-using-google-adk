# Analysis Workflow: Multi-Agent Content Generation System

## Overview

This project is a modular, agent-based content generation system built in Python. It leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) and a suite of specialized agents to analyze a given topic, gather information from multiple sources, perform data analysis, and generate comprehensive reports and social media content. The system is designed for extensibility, parallelism, and automation, making it suitable for advanced content creation and analysis tasks.
This project is an example I have created for the Google ADK Hackathon 2025

## Architecture

The core of the system is the `AnalysisWorkflow` class, which orchestrates a series of agents using both parallel and sequential execution strategies. The workflow is structured as follows:

- **Information Gathering Agents**: Run in parallel to collect data from sources like Exa, Reddit, and News.
- **Analysis Pipeline Agents**: Execute sequentially to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend spotting, and network/relationship analysis.
- **Report Generation Agents**: Sequentially generate a comprehensive report and create content for various platforms (blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit).
- **Combiner Agent**: Aggregates all outputs into a final, unified result.

Each agent is implemented as a class and can be easily extended or replaced. The system uses the `google.adk` framework for agent orchestration and session management.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Combines parallel and sequential agent execution for efficiency and modularity.
- **Automated Content Generation**: Produces detailed reports and platform-specific posts, including images generated by Gemini.
- **Image Handling**: Generated images are saved to a local `generated_images` directory with timestamped filenames.
- **Session Management**: Uses in-memory sessions for tracking workflow state.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add or modify agents for new data sources or content formats.
